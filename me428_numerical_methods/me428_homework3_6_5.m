%Problem 6.5


%% 6.5
% A third-order polynomial of the form y = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D is to be
% fitted to four time-velocity data points. At time x = 0, 1, 2, and 3 s,
% the velocity is measured as 7, 14, 29, and 58 m/s. Using Gaussâ€“Jordan
% elimination, find the curve that passes through these points. Also, solve
% the problem by employing the backslash operator in MATLAB and compare the
% results with those obtained earlier.
